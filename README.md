## My process

I'm actually learning Vue so there's no particular process.
I started with the layout which isn't finished yet, then I added the mathematical logic.

### Built with

- Mobile-first workflow
- [Vue.JS](https://vuejs.org) - JS library
- [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles


### What I learned

I learned conditional rendering with 'v-if' which I still do not fully understand.
And it was a good exercise to practice logical thinking.


### Continued development

I'm still struggling with the day operation which is sometimes render with a negative number.

See example below or full code in the project :
```js
const day = now.getDay() ; // returns a number representing the day of the week, starting with 0 for Sunday
```
```html
<p><span>{{ actualDay }}</span>days</p>
```
